# H89R6J_GUI_2022231

## Description
This project is a database manager software built in C# using .NET Core. The software provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for three tables related to cars: Cars, Engines, and Brands. The project has three user interfaces: console, WPF, and a web-based frontend built with JavaScript and CSS. 

The WPF and web-based frontends are linked together with SignalR to allow for simultaneous usage and real-time updates across both interfaces.
